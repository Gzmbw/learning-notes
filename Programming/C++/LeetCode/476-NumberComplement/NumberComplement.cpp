/**
 * LeetCode Problems 476. Number Complement
 *
 * @file: NumberComplement.cpp
 * @description: Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is
                to flip the bits of its binary representation.
                Note:
                The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
                You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
 * @sample_input:
    Case 1:
    5
    Case 2:
    1
 * @sample_output:
    Case 1:
    2
    (Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement
    is 010. So you need to output 2.)
    Case 2:
    0
    (Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is
    0. So you need to output 0.)
