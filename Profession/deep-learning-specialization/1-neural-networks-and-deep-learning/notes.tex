    \emph{AI is the new Electricity. --- Andrew Ng}
\end{quote}

Electricity had once transformed countless industries: transportation, manufacturing, healthcare,
communications, and more.

AI will now bring about an equally big transformation.

\section{Introduction to Deep Learning}
\subsection{What is a neural network?}
It is powerful learning algorithm inspired by how the brain works.
\subsubsection{Single neural network}
Given data about the size of houses on the real estate market and you want to fit a function that
will predict their price. It is a linear regression problem because the price as a function of size
is a continuous output.

We know the prices can never be negative so we are creating a function called Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) which starts at zero.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=40em]{figures/1-single-nn}
    \caption{The ``Housing Price Prediction'' problem. The input is the size of the house (x);
    The output is the price (y); The ``neuron'' implements the function ReLU.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Multiple neural network}
The price of a house can be affected by other features such as size, number of bedrooms, zip code
and wealth. The role of the neural network is to predicted the price and it will automatically
generate the hidden units. We only need to give the inputs x and the output y.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=40em]{figures/1-multiple-nn}
    \caption{Multiple neural network}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Supervised Learning}
In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know about what our correct output
should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into ``regression'' and ``classification'' problems.
In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results with a continuous output, meaning that we
are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are
instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input
variables into discrete categories.

Here are some example of supervised learning:
\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Supervised Learning Applications}
\begin{tabular}{lllc}
\textbf{Input($x$)} & \textbf{Output($y$)} & \textbf{Application} & \textbf{NN Types} \\ \hline
Home features & Price & Real Estate & Standard NN \\
Ad, user info & Click on ad? (0/1) & Online Advertising & Standard NN \\
Image & Object (1, ..., 1000) & Photo tagging & CNN \\
Audio & Text transcript & Speech Recognition & RNN \\
English & Chinese & Machine translation & RNN \\
Image, Radar info & Position of other cars & Autonomous driving & Custom/Hybrid \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

There are different types of neural network, for example, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used
often for image application and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for one-dimensional sequence
data such as translating English to Chinese or a temporal component such as text transcript. As for
the autonomous driving, it is a hybrid neural network architecture.

\subsubsection{Structured vs unstructed data}
Structed data refers to things that has a defined meaning such as price, age whereas unstructed
data refers to thing like pixel, raw audio, text.

\subsection{Why is Deep Learning taking off?}
Deep learning is taking off due to a large amount of data available through the digitization of the
society, faster computation and innovation in the development of neural network algorithm.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=40em]{figures/1-deep-nn-scale}
    \caption{Scale drives deep learning progress}
\end{figure}

Two things have to be considered to get to the high level of performance:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Being able to train a big enough neural network
    \item Huge amount of labelled data
\end{enumerate}

The process of training a neural network is iterative:
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=25em]{figures/1-train-nn-process}
\end{figure}

It could take a good amount of time to train a neural network, which affects your productivity.
Faster computation helps to iterate and improve new algorithm.
